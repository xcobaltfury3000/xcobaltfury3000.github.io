Not only that, but he also built various state-of-the-art machine learning system using deep learning approaches during his time as a junior research scientist at New York University. Soumith also became a research intern at a company called "Siemens" where he built systems for autonomous robot navigation involving real-time 3D registration and matching of incoming camera images. From July 2012 to August 2014, Soumith was a software engineer at Museami where he built machine learning and vision systems for mobile devices and music (IOS/Android). Lastly, for 6 years and 10 months, Soumith had multiple titles at Facebook AI including an Engineering Manager/Software Engineer, a prinicpal engineer, and a distinguished engineer. Soumith continues to help change world by creating many things in the Machine Learning field.</h3>
